Use a shift register to extend number of control pins
    Might need more nand gates to do this
    
    How to do this???
        1 pin to say we need to use the shift register
            What do we shift out?
            How do we do that in 1(or < 1) microcode?
            Have the microcode pick the pin that enables the 

        May not need a shift register:
            Get this:
                If we use a pin from the EEPROM to say use the extended register (maybe these are always on)
                    but pick a certain one based on the opcode, then we can use the extended gates????


Move the 7 segment register display to the program counter
